I’m currently enrolled in Associates of Science in CS at Langara and I’m planning to transfer to SFU for bachelors. I’ll probably be self employed after college and hopefully start a company. I spend most of my time working on open source projects and helping people out with their problems in CS. As the technical lead, my job is to maintain the club’s tech projects, and build useful tools for the students. I’m always open to collaboration and would love to take suggestions from the members of the community. Besides all that I like playing Doom and listening to rock music."},

This is my second semester at Langara and I’m really excited to have the opportunity to bring this club back! Feel free to say hi if you see me around campus or at an event! :) In my spare time, I listen to listen to unmentionable music, play video games and think too much about dnd 🎉"},

Seeing the Langara Computer Science Club inactive was pretty disappointing, so after the opportunity to revive it was available, I took the opportunity asap. I'm not gonna lie. I play the bass and am trying to get into fighting games. I will try my best to fill my duties as a general rep."},

I really enjoy coding and building programs from scratch. I also love math, so I hope it helps me in both my diploma and my career. I enjoy outdoor activities, reading, painting, and boxing. If you also do, I would love to be your friend! Please feel free to relay all your opinions, good or bad, to help better the club. Looking forward to serving the Langara Computer Science Club as your General Representative!"},

This is my first year here at Langara, and I couldn't be more excited to contribute to our club's growth and create an inclusive community. I am enthusiastic about football, movies, and design. These hobbies bring me immense joy. Additionally, I have a creative side that I express through sketching and exploring different design concepts. Currently, I am eagerly diving into the world of full-stack development, ready to embark on an exciting learning journey. Let's make this club an awesome space to learn, collaborate and have a BLAST together."},

This is my 4th semester doing Langara’s AS Computer Science Program. I can’t wait to create more fun events and find new ways for people to get involved with the Langara Computer Science Club! My hobbies include: airsoft, gaming, 3d printing, programming, dance, gym, cooking, music, building computers, and I’m always looking for new random hobbies! I was previously the Hackathon Lead Coordinator, which was a really fun experience and responsibility I am blessed to share with my team and fellow execs here. I’m excited to bring the skills I’ve learned from managing people towards creating that event into more fun action here, while learning new duties and taking on a more direct club role as well! P.S: Send me your event ideas. I want to know them ALL. :)"}
